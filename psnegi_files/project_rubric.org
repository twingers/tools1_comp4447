* Project

In tools 1 we are concerned with data cleaning and exploratory analysis.
Please select a project having enough scope for following activities.

You will create a github repository for your project and *tag* it with
label for presentation and final report. Github repository must have .ipynb notebook file and associated code.
One should be able to run your project with [[https://mybinder.org/][binder]] link.(In fact we are running most of our notebooks in the class via binder) 

Final report, should read like a data driven story/scientific study (data science). This is really important if you want to publish your story as 
blog in the web or share with stakeholders. Scientific publications have their own style and content requirements.

Use code cell and markdown cell to carry out your analysis.
Please write report using following format sections guidelines. You can create more sections if it is more natural to do so depending on your project.
Please write each section like a report and must address the points mentioned in following rubric. Try to make your report more enjoyable to read.

** Proper tagging of repository for presentation and final report as per deadlines(.5=.25+.25 points)
** Dataset and motivation slide (1 points)
  How/why  dataset was collected and describe the meta data of your dataset.

** Actual task definition/Research Question (2 points) 
  What real-world problem you trying to solve. *What is input and output of your analysis.*

** Literature review (2 points)
  What other work has been done in this area and how is your work novel
  compared to others.
** Quality of cleaning (6 points, 2 points each)
 - Data Cleaning and type conversion activity. Anything unusual you faced during this activity. Please share.
 - What you did about missing values and why?
 - Data summary statistics and interpretation.

** Visualization (8 points, 2 points each)
  - Data Visualization activity(box plot, bar plot, violin plot, pairplot to see relationship and distribution etc).
  - Describe any thing you find in the data after each visualization.
  - What data  visualization help you understanding data distribution.
  - What did you do about possible outlier as per data distribution visualization. (Did you confirm it with your client if it is actually an outlier or put a disclosure statement in notebook if you decided to remove it.)
